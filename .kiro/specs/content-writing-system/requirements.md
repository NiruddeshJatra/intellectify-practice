# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Content Writing Feature Integration enables administrators to create, manage, and publish rich content (blogs/articles) through a dedicated admin interface. The system provides a comprehensive content management solution with rich text editing capabilities using CKEditor 5, separate admin authentication, and a public content display system with search and categorization features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Admin Authentication System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a separate admin login system with email/password authentication, so that I can securely access content management features without relying on OAuth providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin navigates to "/admin/login" THEN the system SHALL display a dedicated admin login form with email and password fields
2. WHEN an admin submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the admin dashboard
3. WHEN an admin submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message
4. WHEN an admin is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain their session using JWT tokens
5. IF an admin is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the admin login page when accessing protected admin routes
6. WHEN the system is deployed THEN admins SHALL be created only through a secure backend script with no UI interface

### Requirement 2: Rich Content Creation and Editing

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to create and edit rich content with text formatting, images, diagrams, links, and videos, so that I can produce engaging blog posts and articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the content creation interface THEN the system SHALL provide a CKEditor 5 rich text editor
2. WHEN an admin writes content THEN the system SHALL support rich text formatting including bold, italic, headers, lists, and links
3. WHEN an admin uploads images THEN the system SHALL store them locally on the server and save only the image URLs in the database
4. WHEN an admin embeds videos or links THEN the system SHALL properly render them in the editor
5. WHEN an admin is writing content THEN the system SHALL provide a near-WYSIWYG experience matching the published appearance
6. WHEN an admin clicks the preview button THEN the system SHALL display how the content will appear when published

### Requirement 3: Content Management and States

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage my content with different states and metadata, so that I can organize and control the publication workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates content THEN the system SHALL assign it a "draft" status by default
2. WHEN an admin publishes content THEN the system SHALL change its status to "published"
3. WHEN content is saved THEN the system SHALL store metadata including author, creation date, last modified date, and custom priority for ordering
4. WHEN an admin views their content list THEN the system SHALL display all content with their current status
5. WHEN an admin sets content priority THEN the system SHALL use this value for ordering content on the homepage
6. WHEN an admin edits existing content THEN the system SHALL preserve the original creation metadata while updating modification timestamps

### Requirement 4: Admin Dashboard and Content Management

**User Story:** As an admin, I want a dedicated dashboard to manage all my content, so that I can efficiently create, edit, delete, and organize my articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with content management options
2. WHEN an admin is on the dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide a prominent "Create Content" button or link
3. WHEN an admin views their content list THEN the system SHALL display all their created content with title, status, priority, and creation date
4. WHEN an admin clicks edit on content THEN the system SHALL open the content in the rich text editor for modification
5. WHEN an admin deletes content THEN the system SHALL remove it permanently after confirmation
6. WHEN non-admin users attempt to access admin endpoints THEN the system SHALL deny access and return appropriate error responses

### Requirement 5: Public Content Display and Homepage

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to view published content on the homepage with basic navigation, so that I can discover and read available articles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a visitor accesses the homepage THEN the system SHALL display recent published content in the main area
2. WHEN content is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a sidebar with content categories for navigation
3. WHEN a visitor clicks on a category THEN the system SHALL filter and display content from that category
4. WHEN a visitor clicks on content THEN the system SHALL display the full article with proper formatting and media
5. WHEN content is displayed on homepage THEN the system SHALL order content by custom priority and creation date

### Requirement 7: User Model Security and Admin Support

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the user model to support both OAuth users and admin users with password authentication, so that the system can handle different authentication methods securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user model is updated THEN the system SHALL make the password field nullable to support OAuth users
2. WHEN the user model is updated THEN the system SHALL make provider and providerId fields nullable to support admin users
3. WHEN a non-admin user attempts to access or modify password fields THEN the system SHALL deny access for security
4. WHEN an admin user is created THEN the system SHALL store a hashed password and set provider fields to null
5. WHEN an OAuth user is created THEN the system SHALL set password to null and populate provider fields
6. WHEN user data is returned via API THEN the system SHALL never include password hashes in responses

### Requirement 8: Image Management and Storage

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to upload and manage images for my content, so that I can create visually appealing articles without worrying about database storage limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin uploads an image THEN the system SHALL store it in the local file system
2. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate a unique filename to prevent conflicts
3. WHEN content is saved THEN the system SHALL store only the image URL/path in the database, not the binary data
4. WHEN content with images is displayed THEN the system SHALL properly serve images from the local storage
5. WHEN an admin deletes content with images THEN the system SHALL handle image cleanup appropriately
