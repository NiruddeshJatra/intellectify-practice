# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security flaws and inconsistencies in the current authentication system migration from localStorage/header-based tokens to HTTP-only cookie-based refresh tokens. The system currently has several implementation bugs that prevent proper functionality and create security vulnerabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Critical Backend Implementation Bugs

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the authentication system to work without runtime errors, so that users can successfully authenticate and maintain sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates refresh tokens THEN the crypto module SHALL be properly imported and available
2. WHEN the refresh token endpoint is called THEN the tokenService SHALL be properly imported in the auth controller
3. WHEN tokens are rotated THEN the system SHALL properly hash tokens for database lookups
4. WHEN JWT secrets are used THEN the system SHALL use consistent secret sources across all modules

### Requirement 2: Implement Secure Session Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my authentication sessions to be properly managed, so that I can securely log out and my tokens are properly revoked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL revoke their refresh token from the database
2. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear authentication cookies from their browser
3. WHEN cookies are cleared THEN the system SHALL use the same options as when setting cookies
4. WHEN a user has multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL support revoking individual or all sessions

### Requirement 3: Clean Up Unused Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the configuration to be clean and only contain necessary secrets, so that the system is maintainable and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing environment variables THEN unused secrets SHALL be removed from configuration
2. IF COOKIE_SECRET is necessary THEN it SHALL be properly configured in the .env file and in the code
3. WHEN COOKIE_SECRET is not used THEN it SHALL be removed from the .env file
4. WHEN JWT secrets are accessed THEN they SHALL use a consistent configuration pattern

### Requirement 4: Migrate Frontend Authentication

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to work seamlessly with the new cookie-based authentication, so that I can authenticate and access protected features without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes authenticated requests THEN it SHALL rely on HTTP-only cookies instead of Authorization headers
2. WHEN access tokens expire THEN the frontend SHALL automatically refresh tokens using the refresh endpoint
3. WHEN users log out THEN the frontend SHALL call the logout endpoint and handle cookie clearing
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the frontend SHALL handle token refresh failures gracefully
5. WHEN the app loads THEN the frontend SHALL check authentication status using the /me endpoint
6. WHEN OAuth callbacks return THEN the frontend SHALL handle JSON responses instead of URL redirects
7. WHEN OAuth authentication completes THEN the frontend SHALL process user data from JSON response and update authentication state

### Requirement 5: Ensure Security Best Practices

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the authentication system to follow security best practices, so that user sessions are protected against common attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refresh tokens are stored THEN they SHALL be hashed in the database
2. WHEN tokens are rotated THEN old tokens SHALL be immediately revoked
3. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL use appropriate security flags (httpOnly, secure, sameSite)
4. WHEN authentication errors occur THEN they SHALL not leak sensitive information
5. WHEN multiple login attempts occur THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent sessions appropriately
